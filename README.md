### Databases

#### MySQL

- Suppose we have two tables `tbl1` and `tbl2`; Each of these tables contains one column on which join condition has been defined. The table `tbl1` contains the column `col1` and the table `tbl2` contains the column `col2`.
  
  - What will the outcome of the following ***inner*** join query?
  
  ```SQL
  SELECT a.col1, b.col2
  FROM tbl1 a INNER JOIN tbl2 b
  ON a.col1 = b.col2
  ```
  
  - What will the outcome of the following ***left outer*** join query?
  
  ```SQL
  SELECT a.col1, b.col2
  FROM tbl1 a LEFT OUTER JOIN tbl2 b
  ON a.col1 = b.col2
  ```
  
  - What will the outcome of the following ***right outer*** join query?
  
  ```SQL
  SELECT a.col1, b.col2
  FROM tbl1 a RIGHT OUTER JOIN tbl2 b
  ON a.col1 = b.col2
  ```
  
  - What will the outcome of the following ***full outer*** join query?
  
  ```SQL
  SELECT a.col1, b.col2
  FROM tbl1 a FULL OUTER JOIN tbl2 b
  ON a.col1 = b.col2
  ```

    In case of:
        - Join columns having ***unique*** values.
        - Join columns having ***duplicate*** values.
        - *One* Join table contains ***Null*** value.
        - *Both* tables containing ***Null*** values.

- Consider the following `staffs` table:
  
  | id  | first_name | last_name | manager_id |
  | --- | ---------- | --------- | ---------- |
  | 1   | Genna      | Jakson    | NULL       |
  | 2   | Adam       | Ahmed     | 1          |
  | 3   | Kali       | Boyer     | 2          |
  | 4   | Layla      | David     | 2          |
  | 5   | Ali        | Mohamed   | 3          |
  
  The `staffs` table stores the staff information such as `id`, `first_name`, and `last_name`. It also has a column named `manager_id` that specifies the direct manager.
  
  Use ***self join*** and ***recursive common table expression (CTE)*** to get who reports to whom?

- Describe and give an example of the ***cross join***?
